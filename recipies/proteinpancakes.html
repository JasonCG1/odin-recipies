    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A breakfast classic now back to aid you in your quests to hit your potein goals.</p>


    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Vanilla Extract</li>
        <li>Sweetner</li>
        <li>Plain Greek Yoghurt</li>
        <li>Protein Powder</li>
        <li>Baking Powder</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Method</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>You start by whisking together the eggs, vanilla, stevia, and Greek yogurt.</li>
        <li>Now, whisk in the protein powder. Whisk patiently and thoroughly until completely smooth and free of lumps, then whisk in the baking powder.</li>
        <li>Heat a nonstick double-burner griddle over medium heat (not higher). Spray it with oil.</li>
        <li>Using a 1.5-tablespoon cookie scoop, pour six to eight mounds of the batter into the griddle (or use a large 14-inch nonstick skillet and cook three or four pancakes at a time).</li>
        <li>Cook the pancakes over medium heat until they bubble on top, 1 minute or even less. Flip and cook them for just a few more seconds, then remove them to a plate, add more fat to the skillet if needed, and cook the remaining pancakes.</li>
    </ol>
